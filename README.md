# Visualizing complaints made against the Rochester Police Department

This is an R Shiny app I made back in 2017 as part of a campaign led by a coalition of community organizations (the [Police Accountability Board Alliance](https://pabnow.github.io/) to pass an independent, civilian-led Police Accountability Board (PAB) in Rochester, NY. Here is the link to the app, hosted on shinyapps.io:

**[RPD Complaints Visualization](https://vlorman.shinyapps.io/RPD_complaints_visualization/)**
 
The app shows how the existing agencies at the time (the Civilian Review Board, the Professional Standards Section (RPD internal affairs), and the Chief of Police) handled complaints of misconduct.

The campaign was a success, and Rochester City Council passed the Police Accountability Board legislation (with all five pillars we'd been advocating for) in November 2019. The legislation then went to a referendum, and it was approved with 75% of the vote!
